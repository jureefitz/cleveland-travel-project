            <h3>Cleveland, a city also known as Believeland.</h3>
            <p>
                This is The Land. The Land for keeping 'em talking. 
                The Land for getting inspired. 
                And The Land for living it up. 
                No matter what, 
                we're never losing sight of who we are or who we're always going to be. 
                And for that, you're welcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                This former industrial city of 2.1 million people has proudly transformed itself 
                into a friendly cultural oasis offering
                “world-class experiences without the world-class ego.”
                Ringed by parkland and set on the shores of Lake Erie, 
                Cleveland offers Midwestern grit mixed with cosmopolitan pleasures;
                visitors can spend equal amounts of time perusing the city's
                first-rate museums as they can downing kielbasas
                and brews while cheering on the city's famous local sports teams. 
                A good time can be had by all in this city that continues to evolve.
